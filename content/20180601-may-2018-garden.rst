Spring is nearing its end in the garden as May closes out. The Farewell-to-Spring (*Clarkia rubicunda*) is budding and the foggy days of summer will be here soon.

Several of the native plants bloomed this month. There were small blossoms on the yerba buena (*Clinopodium douglasii*) and alum root (*Heuchera micrantha*) and much larger blossoms on the Coast Buckwheat (*Eriogonum latifolum*) and Hummingbird Sage (*Salvia spatheca*).

Sadly I finally gave up on the avocado tree I planted this last winter; the site I'd chosen was too windy and not well-enough irrigated. I got another and put in in a pot on our new drip irrigation in a more sheltered location; here's hoping it does better! Another new tree is the small oak (*Quercus agrifola*?) seedling I found growing as a volunteer (some scrub jay or squirrel evidenly forgot about their dinner!) and transplanted into a small pot.

Lastly, I'm looking forward to the `June 2nd Plant Sale <http://www.mountainwatch.org/plantsale/>`_ at the Mission Blue nursery. I'd like to grab a Wood Rose (*Rosa Gymnocarpa*), a Sticky Monkey-Flower (*Mimulus auranticus*), and maybe a fern amongst others.
